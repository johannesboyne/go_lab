Johannes' Playground
====================

Hey stranger, fellow or friend, this is [Johannes Boyne's](http://github.com/johannesboyne) little playground page.

This is really nothing special! Behind this is a Go Application, but as you maybe know, I am more active as Node.js and JavaScript  dev but I extremly like Go, MongoDB, the unix shell...
